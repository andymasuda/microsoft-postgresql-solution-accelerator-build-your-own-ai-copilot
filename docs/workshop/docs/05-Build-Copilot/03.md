# 5.3 Testing the Chat API

## 3.1 Testing Options

The Chat API is deployed against the `/completions/chat` endpoint. So, how can you test this?

- You can use a third party client to `POST` a request to the endpoint
- You can use a `CURL` command to make the request from commandline
- You can use the built-in `/swagger` Swagger UI to [try it out interactively](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#interactive-api-docs)

## 3.2 Test with Swagger

**Let's use option 3** - a side benefit of this is it shows us the _`curl`_ command you can use to make the same request from the terminal if you want to try that out later.

TODO: Update the step below to have them start a debug session from VS Code and then open a browser tab for the API

- Return to the dev server preview tab in the browser (ends in `github.dev`)
- Append `/swagger` to the URL to get the Swagger UI interactive testing page
- Expand the POST section and select `Try it out`
    - Specify a question: `What camping gear do I own already?`
    - Specify a customer_id: try **3** ("Michael Johnson")
    - Specify chat_history: enter `[ ]` (empty list)
- Click `Execute` to run the query

This is similar to our previous testing with the FastAPI endpoint on Azure Container Apps - but now you can **also** see the server execution traces in the Visual Studio Code console.

- **Check:** You should get a valid response in the Swagger UI
- **Check:** You should also see the response traces in the VS Code terminal

**What just happened?**

- The dev server ran the `main.py` defined application with 2 routes
- The default route `/` returns the "Hello world" message (see line 46) TODO: Change line number here
- This confirms that our application server is running successfully
- The `/swagger` UI endpoint displays the endpoints available on the API... TODO: Expand on this.
