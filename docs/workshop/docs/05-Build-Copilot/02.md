# 5.2 Implement the Chat Endpoint

TODO: Add steps for implementing the `/chat` endpoint in the API. This will be updated as they go, so start simple...

Have the users actually add the code (but libraries, such as LangChain should already be in place, added by the requirements.txt file)...

This endpoint should:

- Have RAG capablities (multi-agent or function calling...)
- Use LangChain (already included, so just cover the basics in descriptions)
- Show how to use LangChain's `StructuredTool` (or whatever it is) to call existing functions to get info from the database for RAG\

Next step is to refine the prompt to get better answers... (in next file)

## Review router...



## Create LangChain agents

TODO: Add code for creating LangChain agents for performing data lookups

TODO: LangChain implementation should already be done, so this will just be reviewing the code a

How does this compare to using function calls for a single agent? Is it just splitting that across agents, so they perform data lookups in parallel?

Need to consider token limits...
