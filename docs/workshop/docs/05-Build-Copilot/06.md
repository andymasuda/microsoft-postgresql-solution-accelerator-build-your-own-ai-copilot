# 5.6 Use Semantic Ranking

- TODO
  - Review ranking model deployed in Azure Machine Learning Studio
  - Implement ranker in query/endpoint
  - Figure out what else should be done here

This solution accelerator is designed to extend your PostgreSQL instance on Azure with the ability to perform semantic ranking directly in the SQL query language. The solution accelerator provides two components:

1. Automated Deployment Script: This script provisions the Semantic Ranker model as an Azure Machine Learning (AML) inference endpoint in your subscription.
2. SQL Integration: A SQL User Defined Function (UDF) integrates the Semantic Ranker model directly into SQL queries. The function makes use of the azure_ai extension to make remote calls to the AML inference endpoint.

The architecture of the Solution Accelerator is shown below:
