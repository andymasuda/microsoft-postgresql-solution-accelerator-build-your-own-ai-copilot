# 5.9 Redeploy App

With the _Woodgrove Bank Contract Management_ application's API and UI updated to include your intelligent copilot, all that is left to do is deploy the updated application into ACA in Azure.

## Deploy the Updated App

1. Open a new intergated terminal in VS Code. Then, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    azd deploy
    ```

    !!! tip "Understand the difference between `azd up` and `azd deploy`"

    The `azd up` and `azd deploy` commands are both part of the Azure Developer CLI, but they serve different purposes:

    - `azd up` is used to package, provision, and deploy your application to Azure. It essentially sets up the entire environment, including infrastructure and application code, from scratch. It's typically used when you're starting a new project or making significant changes to your infrastructure.

    - `azd deploy` is used to update an existing deployment. It's useful for making iterative changes to your application without having to re-provision the entire environment. This command is ideal for continuous development and deployment scenarios where you're frequently updating your application.

    In other words, use `azd up` when you need to set up everything from the beginning, and `azd deploy` when you're updating an existing deployment.

## Test the Deployed App

1. In the Azure portal, return to the resource group containing your resources and select the **Container app** resource whose name begins with **ca-portal**.
