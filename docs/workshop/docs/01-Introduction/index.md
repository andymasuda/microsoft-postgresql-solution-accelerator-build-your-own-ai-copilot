# Introduction

## Learning Objectives

The workshop teaches you to **build, evaluate, and deploy a financial services industry-based copilot** on Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure AI. By the end of the workshop, you will learn to:

- Use the [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation) <br/> (to ground responses in your own data).
- Use [Azure Container Apps](https://aka.ms/azcontainerapps) <br/> for deployment (to get a hosted API endpoint for real-world use).
- Use [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev) with GitHub Codespaces <br/> (to get a consistent, reproducible environment across teams)
- Use [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd) with AI Application Templates <br/> (to provision & deploy apps consistently across teams)
