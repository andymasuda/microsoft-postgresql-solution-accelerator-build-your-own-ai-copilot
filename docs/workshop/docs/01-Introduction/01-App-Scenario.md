# 1. The App Scenario

In the financial services industry, validating contracts, statements of work (SOWs), and invoices poses distinct challenges. This is particularly true when it comes to ensuring that invoices align with SOWs, especially for milestone-based payments and other specific deliverables. Traditionally, this validation process is manual, requiring meticulous comparison and cross-checking, often leading to delays, errors, and elevated operational costs. This accelerator explores a high-level architectural solution utilizing Microsoft Azure's comprehensive suite of services to automate and streamline this process, resulting in faster, more accurate, and cost-effective invoice validation.

Here are some use cases and advantages:

**Use Cases**:

1. **Accuracy and Compliance**
   - Ensure that invoices match the services or products agreed upon in the SoW.
   - Detect discrepancies between invoices and the SoW to prevent overbilling or underbilling.

2. **Automated Validation**
   - Automatically validate invoices against contract terms, including pricing, quantities, and service descriptions.
   - Reduce the manual effort required for invoice verification and approval.

3. **Fraud Detection**
   - Identify potential fraudulent activities by detecting inconsistencies between the invoices and the SoW.
   - Implement anomaly detection algorithms to flag unusual patterns or deviations.

4. **Budget Management**
   - Monitor spending by comparing invoices to the budgeted amounts in the SoW.
   - Provide insights into budget adherence and financial planning.

5. **Streamlined Approval Workflow**
   - Automate the approval process by routing invoices to the appropriate stakeholders for review.
   - Track the status of invoices and ensure timely payments.

6. **Dispute Resolution:**
   - Facilitate quicker resolution of disputes by providing a clear comparison of invoices and the SoW.
   - Maintain a record of discrepancies for future reference and audit trails.

**Advantages**:

- **Increased Efficiency:** Automate repetitive tasks and reduce manual effort, allowing employees to focus on more strategic activities.
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** Minimize errors and ensure that invoices align with contract terms, reducing the risk of financial discrepancies.
- **Cost Savings:** Detect and prevent overbilling, leading to significant cost savings over time.
- **Improved Transparency:** Provide clear visibility into invoice processing and SoW adherence, enhancing accountability.
- **Better Compliance:** Ensure compliance with contractual terms and internal policies, reducing legal and financial risks.

Such an application can be integrated with existing financial and accounting systems to streamline the entire process. By leveraging AI and machine learning, it can continuously learn and improve its accuracy in detecting discrepancies and anomalies.

The workshop teaches you to **build, evaluate, and deploy a financial services copilot** on Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure AI. The application scenario involves an enterprise **frontend** (User Portal) integrated with a custom copilot **backend** (API app), to provide data management and a chat-based customer support experience to users. *Click each tab below, to learn more!*
