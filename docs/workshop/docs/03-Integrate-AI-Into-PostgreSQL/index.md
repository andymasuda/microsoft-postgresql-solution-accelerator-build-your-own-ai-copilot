# Integrate Generative AI into Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

Generative AI (GenAI) represents a cutting-edge class of AI algorithms designed to create new, original content based on patterns and data learned from existing information. Natural language processing (NLP) is a key part of this. NLP allows generative AI to understand and produce human language, making it capable of tasks like summarizing large blocks of text, translating languages, or conversing with people. Using NLP, generative AI can create content that sounds natural and makes sense in context. By employing techniques like prompting and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), GenAI can produce innovative outputs, such as text, images, and more.

Incorporating Generative AI (GenAI) within Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server is accomplished through the Azure AI (`azure_ai`) and pgvector (`vector`) extensions. The `azure_ai` extension enables the integration of large language models (LLMs) directly within your database, providing seamless interaction with Azure's advanced AI services, such as Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Services. With these integrations, you can elevate your applications by embedding robust AI functionalities directly into your database infrastructure. The `vector` extension works with the `azure_ai` extension, allowing vector embeddings to be generated in database queries, then stored and queried in the database. It also enables powerful vector similarity search capabilities.

In addition, the `pg_diskann` extension enables DiskANN support for efficient vector indexing and searching. DiskANN is a scalable approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm for efficient vector search at any scale. It offers high recall, high queries per second, and low query latency, even for billion-point datasets.

In this section, you will use extensions to enhance your PostgreSQL database with Generative AI and Vector Search capabilities. Here's what you will accomplish:

- [ ] Install the `azure_ai`, `pg_diskann`, and `vector` extensions on your PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Configure the `azure_ai` extension with the connection details for your Azure AI services
- [ ] Add vector columns to database tables to allow embeddings to be stored alongside text data
- [ ] Improve vector query performance with DiskANN
- [ ] Generate and store embeddings for existing data

Following these steps will transform your PostgreSQL database into a powerful AI-enhanced platform capable of executing advanced generative AI tasks and providing deeper insights from your data.
