=== "Local computer validation"

    TODO: 
        - Validate database by querying the `vendors` table from pgAdmin (this also serves as validation for data deployment into the database in Azure)
        - Validate Python and API configuration by running the API project from VS Code and ensuring the Swagger UI is accessible -- Try out the `/vendors` endpoint
        - Validate Node.js and UI config by running the UI project -- Navigate to the Vendors page?

    ## 1. Validate the database deployment

    Using pgAdmin, you will quickly execute a few queries to validate the database was deployed and populated correctly.

    1. TODO: Return to your open pgAdmin instance (or open a new one) and ensure you are connected to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.

    2. Expand the server and its databases, and right-click on the `contracts` database.

    3. Select **Query Tool** from the context menu, and in the query window, paste the following SQL statement:

        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM vendors;
        ```

    4. TODO: Add a bit more here...

    ## 2. Run API Server Locally

    To verify the API is wired up correctly, you will runs a preview version of the API server locally, with hot reload, for rapid iteration.
    
    TODO: To run the FastAPI Dev server... 
    
    1. TODO: They can press F5 or have them go to the Debug area in VS Code, select the **Python Debugger: FastAPI** from the drop down list, and then select the **Start Debugging** button.
    
    2. TODO: Verify that this starts a _development server_ and open the API in a browser...

        

    3. TODO: 
        
        - You should see: a pop-up dialog with two options to view the application
        - Select the "Browser" option - should open the preview in a new browser tab
        - Check the browser URL - should be a path ending in `github.dev`
        - Check the page content - should show the "Hello World" message
    
    ## 2. Connect the Dots! ðŸ’¡
    
    3. The `github.dev` ending validates the server is hosted by GitHub Codespaces 
        - This verifies we are running in the (local) dev environment. 
        - When deployed to production, you'll see `containerapps.io` (for ACA).
    
    4. What just happened?
    
        - The dev server ran the `main.py` defined application with 2 routes
        - The default route `/` returns the "Hello world" message (see line 46)
        - This confirms that our application server is running successfully.

=== "Azure validation"

    TODO: List the resources to be provisioned by the Bicep template executed by the `azd up` command.

    !!! tip "The Azure Portal allows you to view the resources provisioned on Azure and check that they are setup correctly"

    Here's a reminder of the Azure Application Architecture you can reference as you check your provisioned Resource Group to enure these resources were created.
    
    ![Solution Architecture](../../img/data-ingestion-validation-architecture-diagram.png)

    ## 1. Inspect deployed Azure resources

    1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the link below. You may be prompted to login.
        ``` title=""
        https://portal.azure.com/#browse/resourcegroups
        ```
    
        !!! task "If you are doing the Instructor-Led track and are prompted to sign in, use the `Username` and `Password` from the 'Azure Credentials' section in your Skillable Lab instructions panel."

    2. You may be presented with a "Welcome to Microsoft Azure" screen. Click **Cancel** (to dismiss it) or click **Get Started** (to take an introductory tour of the Azure Portal).

    3. You should be taken directly to the Resource Groups page for your subscription.

        - In the list of resource groups, you should see one named `rg-postgresql-accelerator` (or, if you assigned a different name, one by specified name). This resource group was created for you as part of the `azd up` resource deployment. It contains all of the Azure resources required to build and deploy your AI-enable solution.

        !!! tip "You can use the search filter to reduce the number resource groups displayed."

    4. Select the `rg-postgres-accelerator` resource group.

        - **Check:** Deployments (look under "Essentials") - You should see: *35 succeeded*. 
        - **Check:** Resources (in Overview) - You should see: *20 resources*.
    
    !!! task "Leave the Azure Portal open on this tab. We'll revisit it later."

    ## 3.3 Azure Container App Tab
    
    !!! tip "The Azure Container App provides the hosting environment for our copilot (API endpoint)"
    
    [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview) will host the endpoint used to serve the Contoso Chat application on the Contoso Outdoors website. The Azure provisioning should have deployed a default Azure Container App to this endpoint.
    
    7. Return to the Azure Portal tab
    8.  Visit the `rg-AITOUR` Resource group page
    9.  Click the `Container App` resource to display the Overview page
    10. Look for `Application Url` (at top right), and click it to launch in new tab
    11. You should see: A `Hello World` message on the screen (confirming app was deployed)
    
    !!! info "Azure Container Apps (ACA) is used to host our chat AI application. The application server is implemented using FastAPI and exposes a `/create_request` API endpoint to make requests to our copilot."
    
    ## 3.4. Check Azure Database for PostgreSQL
    
    The Azure Database for PostgreSQL resource holds the data for the application. It contains data for each vendor, and the SOWs and invoices associated with them.
    
    12. Switch to the **Azure Portal** tab and display the `rg-AITOUR` resource group Overview
    13. **Click** the `Azure Cosmos DB account` resource name to visit its details page
    14. **Click** `Data Explorer` in the top-nav menu 
        - dismiss the popup dialog to skip the movie
        - see: `contoso-outdoor` container with `customers` database
        - click `customers`, then select `Items`
        - you should see: **12 data items in database**
    
    ## 3.5. Check Azure Container App
    
    !!! info "How The Custom Copilot Experience Works"
    
        Our chat application works by sending chat messages to a custom endpoint hosted as an Azure Container App. 
        
        - The inputs to the endpoint are 
            - **question** â†’ the customer's chat message), 
            - **customer_id** â†’ the logged-in customer's ID number)
            - **chat_history** â†’ the prior conversation, for context. 
        - The **response** from the endpoint is the response returned by the chatbot.
    
        When iterating on a prototype application, we start with manual testing, using a single "test prompt" to validate our scenario. We then move to automated evaluations with larger test datasets.
      
    The FastAPI server exposes a `Swagger API` endpoint that we can use for manual testing in both local (Codespaces) and cloud (Container Apps). Let's try it out now!
    
    15. Return to your deployed Azure Container App tab
    16. Add a `/docs` suffix to the URL and browse to that path - you will see: **FastAPI** page
    17. Expand the `POST` section by clicking the arrow
        - click `Try it out` to make inputs editable
        - enter `Tell me about your tents` for **question**
        - enter `2` for **customer_id**
        - enter `[]` for **chat_history**
        - enter **Execute** to run the endpoint with the provided parameters.
        
    You will get a response body with `question`, `answer` and `context` components. 
    
    - **Check** `question` -  is the customer's question the same as that typed in the chat window on the Contoso Outdoor website
    - **Check** `answer` -  is the chatbot's response to the customer's `question`, as generated by this RAG application
    - **Check** `context` - is the additional information provided to the Generative AI model being used by it used to ground its answer.
        - In this app, that includes information about products relevant to the customer question.
        - The products selected may depend on `customer_id` and the associated order history. 
        - The web app provides `chat_history` from the chat window - which can serve as additional context that the model can use to ground the response.
    
    !!! note "Exercise â†’ Repeat exercise with a different customer ID (between 1 and 12). How did the response change?"

## 3.7. Let's Connect The Dots ðŸ’¡

!!! info "Recall that the [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation#how-does-rag-work) works by *retrieving* relevant knowledge from your data stores, and _augmenting_ the user query with it to create an enhanced prompt - which _generates_ the final response."

To implement this RAG pattern, we need to execute three steps:

1. **Setup data sources** and populate them with our data (product catalog, customer orders)
1. **Create [indexes](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation#how-does-rag-work)** for efficient information retrieval by LLMs (e.g., find matching products)
1. **Connect our Azure AI project** to access data/indexes code-first, for use in processing steps.

In the previous section we setup the data sources (provisioning infra) and populated them with data (post-provisioning scripts) as follows:

1. **Azure CosmosDB** - loaded **12 records** from `data/customer_info`, got _customers_ database.
1. **Azure AI Search** - loaded **20 records** from `data/product_info`, got _contoso-products_ index.

This checks off the first two idents from our RAG checklist above. Now, let's see how we can achieve the thirst ep with a code-first approach that makes use of the Azure AI Search, Azure CosmosDB and Azure OpenAI services through their Azure SDKs.
