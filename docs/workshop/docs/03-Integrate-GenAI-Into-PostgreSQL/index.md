# Integrate Generative AI into Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

Generative AI (GenAI) represents a cutting-edge class of AI algorithms designed to create new, original content based on patterns and data learned from existing information. Natural language processing (NLP) is a key part of this. NLP allows generative AI to understand and produce human language, making it capable of tasks like summarizing large blocks of text, translating languages, or having conversations with people. By using NLP, generative AI can create content that sounds natural and makes sense in context. By employing techniques like prompting and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), GenAI can produce innovative outputs, such as text, images, and more.

Incorporating Generative AI (GenAI) within Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server is accomplished through the `azure_ai` extension. This extension enables the integration of large language models (LLMs) directly within your database. Using the extension allows you to interact seamlessly with Azure's advanced AI services, such as Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Services, directly from the database. With this integration, you can elevate your applications by embedding robust AI functionalities directly into your database infrastructure.

In the steps in this section, you will enhance your PostgreSQL database by integrating Generative AI capabilities using the `azure_ai` extension. This process includes configuring your database to connect with Azure AI and ML services and enabling it to handle AI-driven tasks effectively. Here's what you will accomplish:

- [ ] Enable the `age`, `vector`, and `azure_ai` extensions on your PostgreSQL server by adding them to the _allowlist_. These extensions are crucial for AI integration and vector operations.
- [ ] Integrate Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities into Azure Database for PostgreSQL using the Azure AI (`azure_ai`) extension
- [ ] Configure the `azure_ai` extension to provide the endpoints to connect to the Azure AI services and the API keys required for authentication
- [ ] Add vector columns to database tables to allow embeddings to be stored alongside text data
- [ ] Vectorize existing data

By following these steps, you will transform your PostgreSQL database into a powerful AI-enhanced platform capable of executing advanced generative AI tasks and providing deeper insights from your data.
