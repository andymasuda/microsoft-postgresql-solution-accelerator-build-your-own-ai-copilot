# 6.1 Install Apache AGE extension




Apache AGE (`age`)

# 6.1  Create and Query Graph Data

With AGE installed, you are ready to start creating and querying graph data using OpenCypher.

TODO: Expand on the below and provide good examples

In this example you use OpenCypher and AGE to determine the connections or relationships between the SOWs and vendors and invoices they have submitted.

To accomplish this, you will need to create a set of nodes (vertices) and relationships (edges):

Note: You will need to set the ag_catalog schema in your path to utilize cypher or you will need to specify it directly in the query as shown in the following examples:

```sql
SET search_path = ag_catalog, "$user", public;
```

Or

```sql
ag_catalog.cypher(query)
```







## Update API to allow GraphRAG

TODO: Add a new API endpoint associated with the copilot to allow GraphRAG queries to be executed and relationship nodes returned...
