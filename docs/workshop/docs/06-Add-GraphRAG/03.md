# 6.3 Execute cypher queries

Now that you have a populated graph, you can use cypher queries to demonstrate these relationships.

Find all invoices submitted by TODO vendor:

TODO: Fix the `graph_name` reference above to use a standard one for the solution accelerator so it doesn't need to be updated in the queries...

```sql
SELECT * FROM ag_catalog.cypher('graph_name', $$
MATCH (kb:Actor {name: 'Kevin Bacon'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(coactor:Actor)
RETURN coactor.name AS CoActor
$$) as (CoActor agtype);​
```

Find all SOWs for vendor TODO:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ag_catalog.cypher('graph_name', $$
MATCH (kb:Actor {name: 'Kevin Bacon'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Director)
RETURN d.name AS Director
$$) as (Director agtype);​
```

Find all movies where Kevin Bacon and another specific actor have acted together:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ag_catalog.cypher('graph_name', $$
MATCH (kb:Actor {name: 'Kevin Bacon'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(coactor:Actor {name: 'Actor 1'})
RETURN m.title AS Movie
$$) as (Movie agtype);​
```

Find all directors who have directed movies with Kevin Bacon and another specific actor:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ag_catalog.cypher('graph_name', $$
MATCH (kb:Actor {name: 'Kevin Bacon'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(coactor:Actor {name: 'Actor 1'})
MATCH (d:Director)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)
RETURN d.name AS Director
$$) as (Director agtype);​
```

These queries will help you explore the relationships between vendors, invoices, and their associated SOWs in your graph database. Remember to replace 'graph_name' with the actual name of your graph.
