# Improve RAG Accuracy

As Generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly integral to modern enterprises, users' trust in these applications is paramount and heavily reliant on the accuracy of the responses they generate. The productivity loss from incorrect answers and the consequent erosion of user trust are issues that cannot be overlooked. For many organizations, the decision to deploy GenAI apps hinges on their ability to elevate the accuracy of the app's responses to an acceptable level.

## The Accuracy Problem

Despite significant advancements, accuracy remains a challenge for GenAI. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by grounding responses in factual data. Still, as datasets expand or when documents become too similar, vector search techniques can falter, leading to a loss of user trust and diminished productivity. Enhancing accuracy requires optimizing the information retrieval pipeline through various techniques. General methods include chunking, larger embeddings, and hybrid search, while advanced, dataset-specific approaches like semantic ranking and GraphRAG are essential.

## Enhance GenAI Accuracy with Advanced Techniques

Innovations like Semantic Ranking and GraphRAG are crucial to address the accuracy problem. These techniques enhance the RAG approach by improving how grounding data is gathered and integrated into AI model responses, thereby increasing precision and reliability. Optimizing information retrieval pipelines through advanced techniques ensures that GenAI applications deliver accurate, trustworthy, and insightful responses, thereby maintaining user trust and productivity.

_Select the tabs below to understand how Semantic Ranking and GraphRAG can improve RAG accuracy._

=== "Semantic Ranking"

    Semantic ranking is an advanced technique used in information retrieval systems to enhance the relevance of search results by understanding the context and meaning of queries and documents, rather than relying solely on keyword matching. By leveraging natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, semantic ranking can analyze the relationships between words and concepts to provide more accurate and meaningful results. This approach allows search engines to better comprehend the intent behind user queries and deliver results that are contextually aligned with what users are looking for. The benefits of semantic ranking include improved accuracy in search results, enhanced user satisfaction, and more efficient retrieval of information, making it a powerful tool for modern search engines and recommendation systems.

=== "GraphRAG"

    GraphRAG, developed by Microsoft Research, is an innovative approach to information retrieval and generation, combining the power of knowledge graphs with large language models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy and relevance of generated content. GraphRAG allows LLMs to provide more contextually aware and insightful responses by integrating structured data from knowledge graphs into the retrieval process. This method enhances the model's ability to understand complex queries and synthesize information from various sources, leading to more accurate and informative outputs. GraphRAG's benefits include improved information retrieval, enhanced reasoning capabilities, and the ability to deliver precise answers even when dealing with intricate or multi-faceted questions.
