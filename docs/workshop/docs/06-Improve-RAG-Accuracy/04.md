# 6.4 Review GraphRAG

**GraphRAG** (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an innovative technique developed by Microsoft Research. It significantly enhances the accuracy and relevance of responses generated by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. _Graph_ refers to a data structure that represents entities and their relationships. This structure is often visualized as nodes (vertices) and edges, where nodes represent entities and edges represent the relationships or connections between these entities.

The GraphRAG technique involves three main steps:

1. **Graph Extraction**: Creating a knowledge graph from the source data.
2. **Entity Summarization**: Summarizing entities within the graph to capture essential information.
3. **Graph Query Generation**: Generating graph queries at query time to retrieve relevant information based on the prominence and relationships within the graph.

In the context of Azure Database for PostgreSQL, GraphRAG leverages the structure of knowledge graphs extracted from source data to provide better context and improve the quality of responses from language models. By integrating GraphRAG with PostgreSQL, you can enhance the information retrieval pipeline, making it more accurate and context-aware. This is particularly useful for applications where the accuracy and relevance of information are critical.

## GraphRAG with AGE

[Apache Graph Extension](https://age.apache.org/age-manual/master/index.html) (AGE) is a PostgreSQL extension developed under the Apache Incubator project. It offers a significant advancement that provides graph processing capabilities within the PostgreSQL ecosystem, enabling users to store and query graph data efficiently. This new extension brings a powerful toolset for developers looking to leverage a graph database with the robust enterprise features of Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
