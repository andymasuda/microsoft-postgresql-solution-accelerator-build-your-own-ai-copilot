# Before You Begin

This guide serves as both a solution accelerator and a learning tool for developers who want to build AI-powered solutions built on top of Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure AI Services. The **Woodgrove Bank** solution is an actively updated project that will reflect the latest features and best practices for development of AI-enabled applications and RAG-based copilots on the Azure AI platform.

You can complete it as a **self-guided** workshop at home. Instructor-led workshop options will be provided in the near future.
