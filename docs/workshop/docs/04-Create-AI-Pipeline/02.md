# 4.2 Configure Semantic Chunking

Semantic chunking is a critical step in preparing documents for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and other AI-driven workflows. It involves breaking down large documents into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks that enable better indexing, searching, and retrieval. Using Azure Document Intelligence, semantic chunking can be configured to optimize data flow for downstream processes. Below is a guide to configuring semantic chunking effectively.

## What Are Chunks in Document Intelligence?

In **Azure AI Document Intelligence**, "chunks" refer to structured segments of a document that are intelligently divided to improve data extraction, retrieval, and validation. This process, known as **Semantic Chunking**, ensures that information is logically grouped based on its meaning and context, rather than arbitrary divisions like page numbers.

### How Chunks Work

1. **Semantic Understanding:** Instead of treating a document as a single block of text, AI models recognize key sections such as headings, paragraphs, tables, and lists.

1. **Context Preservation:** By maintaining the relationship between different parts of the document, chunking helps AI models interpret financial statements, SOWs, and invoices more accurately.

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** models can retrieve relevant chunks dynamically, improving AI-driven document validation, compliance checks, and financial data reconciliation.

### **Why Chunks Matter in AI-Powered Data Validation**

- **Higher Accuracy:** Structured document segmentation improves AI’s ability to **extract and validate key financial data**.  
- **Better Contextual Retrieval:** When comparing invoices to **Statements of Work (SOWs)**, AI can **retrieve specific clauses** related to payment terms.  
- **Optimized Query Performance:** AI-powered searches return **more precise** and **context-aware** results.

## **Defining the Chunking Strategy in Document Intelligence**

When working with Statements of Work (SOWs) and Invoices, defining an effective chunking strategy is essential to ensure accurate data extraction, validation, and cross-referencing. The way chunks are structured depends on the document type, as **SOWs** and **Invoices** have different formats, purposes, and data requirements.

### **Chunking Strategy for Statements of Work (SOWs)**

SOWs are **long, structured documents** that outline contractual obligations, payment milestones, deliverables, and compliance clauses. The chunking strategy for SOWs must focus on **preserving contextual integrity** while making it easy to retrieve relevant sections.

#### **Key Chunking Considerations for SOWs:**

1. **Logical Sectioning:**  
    1. Chunk based on headings, subheadings, and numbered clauses (e.g., **"Scope of Work"**, **"Payment Terms"**, **"Milestones"**).  
    1. Ensures that AI can retrieve relevant contract details when cross-referencing invoices.  

1. **Paragraph-Based Semantic Chunking:**  
    1. Break sections into **semantically meaningful paragraphs** for precise retrieval.  
    1. Helps ensure **RAG-based AI models** understand contract obligations.

1. **Compliance Clause Recognition:**
    1. Identify and separately chunk regulatory or compliance language to facilitate **automated legal checks**.

1. **Deliverbale Based Segmentation:**  
    1. Define chunks based on **payment deliverables**, linking them to expected invoice amounts.  

### **Chunking Strategy for Invoices**

Invoices are **structured, tabular documents** designed to list billable items, amounts, and due dates. Unlike SOWs, invoice chunking must focus on tabular data extraction, line-item accuracy, and direct matching with SOWs.

#### **Key Chunking Considerations for Invoices:**

1. **Line-Item Chunking:**  
    1. Each **line item (e.g., service, quantity, amount, tax, etc.)** is treated as a separate chunk for precise AI validation.  
1. **Table-Aware Chunking:**  
    1. Preserve **tabular structures** to ensure AI correctly extracts and processes invoice totals, taxes, and discounts.

1. **Semantic Chunking for Descriptions:**  
    1. Invoice descriptions may **reference project deliverables**—chunking ensures AI can **cross-validate them against SOW deliverables**.  

1. **Vendor & Payment Terms Segmentation:**  
    1. Vendor details, invoice dates, and due dates must be separately chunked to ensure **accurate payment milestone validation**.  

### **Differences in Chunking Strategy:**

| Aspect                | SOW Chunking Strategy | Invoice Chunking Strategy |
|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Document Structure** | Long-form contract with sections | Structured tables with line items |
| **Chunking Method** | Section & paragraph-based chunking | Table-aware & line-item chunking |
| **Key Chunking Focus** | Milestones, deliverables, compliance clauses | Billable items,  payment details |
| **AI Retrieval Purpose** | Validate contractual obligations & compliance | Match billable amounts & due dates with SOWs |

### **Why an Optimized Chunking Strategy Matters**

**Improves AI Accuracy** – Ensures that document validation is based on structured, meaningful chunks.  
**Enhances Cross-Document Validation** – Allows AI models to **match invoices to SOWs efficiently**.  
**Supports Compliance & Auditability** – Ensures that all necessary sections are **properly reviewed**.  
**Optimizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Queries** – AI can retrieve **precise contract and invoice details** for analysis.

## **Leverage Azure Document Intelligence**

Azure Document Intelligence provides tools and capabilities to automate the chunking process:

1. **Use Pre-Trained Models**:
   - Apply pre-trained models to extract structured data and identify logical sections within documents. In this workshop 2 models were used:
      1. The **prebuilt-invoice** model in Document Intelligence was used to process invoices as this model is designed to extract key information from invoices, such as vendor details, invoice date, and total amount due. This model leverages advanced machine learning techniques to streamline the processing of invoices, reducing manual data entry and improving accuracy.
      1. The **prebuilt-document** model in Document Intelligence was used to process Statement of Works as this model is designed to extract structured data from a variety of document types, such as contracts, receipts, and forms. This model uses machine learning to identify and extract relevant information, enabling efficient document processing and data management.

2. **Apply Custom Models**:
   - If the pre-built models will not work for your domain-specific documents then you use custom models trained on those documents to identify sections unique to your use case/organization.
   [Follow this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/build-a-custom-model?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)

3. **Configure Semantic Rules**:
   - Define rules or conditions to segment documents based on semantic content.
   - Example: Break a contract into "Parties Involved," "Obligations," and "Terms and Conditions" sections.

### **Store Chunks in Azure Database for PostgreSQL**

Once documents are semantically chunked, the resulting chunks are stored in **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** for efficient querying and retrieval:

- **Data Structure**:
  - Each chunk is stored as an individual record with metadata for easy identification.
  - Example Schema:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE sow_chunks (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        sow_id INT,
        heading, TEXT,
        chunk_content TEXT,
        chunk_metadata JSONB
    );
    ```

- **Metadata**:
  - This can include metadata such as document ID, chunk sequence, and semantic labels for efficient retrieval.

---

### **Benefits of Semantic Chunking**

- **Enhanced Retrieval**:
  - Enables precise querying of specific document sections, improving the accuracy of AI-driven responses.

- **Optimized Indexing**:
  - Reduces the complexity of indexing large documents by focusing on smaller, meaningful sections.

- **Improved AI Performance**:
  - Ensures AI models operate within token limits, avoiding truncation and enhancing output quality.
