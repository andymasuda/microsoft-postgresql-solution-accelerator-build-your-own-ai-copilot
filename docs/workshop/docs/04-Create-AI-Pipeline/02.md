## Configure Semantic Chunking

Semantic chunking is a critical step in preparing documents for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and other AI-driven workflows. It involves breaking down large documents into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks that enable better indexing, searching, and retrieval. Using Azure Document Intelligence, semantic chunking can be configured to optimize data flow for downstream processes. Below is a guide to configuring semantic chunking effectively.

---

### **1. Define the Chunking Strategy**

Before implementing semantic chunking, it is essential to define a strategy tailored to the document’s content and the use case:

- **Determine Chunk Size**:
  - Decide the size of each chunk based on the complexity of the document and the AI model’s token limits.
  - For example, divide a lengthy Statement of Work document into sections such as "Project Scope", "Schedules", and "Project Deliverables".

- **Identify Semantically Relevant Boundaries**:
  - Use natural breakpoints like paragraphs, headings, or bullet points.
  - For structured documents, align chunks with logical sections, such as "Invoice Details" or "Payment Terms."

---

### **2. Leverage Azure Document Intelligence**

Azure Document Intelligence provides tools and capabilities to automate the chunking process:

1. **Use Pre-Trained Models**:
   - Apply pre-trained models to extract structured data and identify logical sections within documents.

2. **Apply Custom Models**:
   - Use custom models trained on domain-specific documents to identify sections unique to your organization.

3. **Configure Semantic Rules**:
   - Define rules or conditions to segment documents based on semantic content.
   - Example: Break a contract into "Parties Involved," "Obligations," and "Terms and Conditions" sections.

---

### **3. Store Chunks in Azure Database for PostgreSQL**

Once documents are semantically chunked, the resulting chunks are stored in **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** for efficient querying and retrieval:

- **Data Structure**:
  - Each chunk is stored as an individual record with metadata for easy identification.
  - Example Schema:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE sow_chunks (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        sow_id INT,
        heading, TEXT,
        chunk_content TEXT,
        chunk_metadata JSONB
    );
    ```

- **Metadata**:
  - This can include metadata such as document ID, chunk sequence, and semantic labels for efficient retrieval.

---

### **4. Benefits of Semantic Chunking**

- **Enhanced Retrieval**:
  - Enables precise querying of specific document sections, improving the accuracy of AI-driven responses.

- **Optimized Indexing**:
  - Reduces the complexity of indexing large documents by focusing on smaller, meaningful sections.

- **Improved AI Performance**:
  - Ensures AI models operate within token limits, avoiding truncation and enhancing output quality.

By configuring semantic chunking using Azure Document Intelligence, organizations can streamline document workflows, improve data accessibility, and enable more effective AI-powered retrieval and analysis.
