# 4.3 Summarize documents

_TODO: Use the `azure_ai` extension's `azure_cognitive` schema to perform abstractive summarization on SOWs (and invoices?)._

_TODO: Summaries should be created using the extension as part of an update statement on the tables._

_TODO: Perhaps have a button on the UI that kicks off the summarization process, or should it be part of the ingestion process? If so, the docs here will need to have them build the final insert queries over a few steps and then run it at the end, so minor restructuring, but probably the right way to go._

Azure Cognitive Services, specifically the **Azure Language Service's Summarization** capability, provides advanced abstractive text summarization to condense complex documents like **Statements of Work (SoWs)** into concise summaries.

By integrating this capability with the **PostgreSQL Azure_AI extension**, you can dynamically generate summaries for documents stored in relational tables, streamlining workflows and improving document accessibility.

## Summarizing Statements of Work (SoWs)

SoWs in the financial industry often contain extensive details about project scope, deliverables, and milestones. Summarizing these documents into a few sentences allows decision-makers to quickly grasp the key information without reading through lengthy documents.

### Key Benefits for Summarization

- **Time Efficiency**: Quickly identify critical information from long-form documents.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Summaries provide concise overviews, improving decision-making processes.
- **Scalable Automation**: Automatically generate summaries for large volumes of documents without manual intervention.

Azure's Summarization API within the **Language Service** enables abstractive summarization, creating human-like summaries that convey the document's essence rather than just extracting key phrases.

## Using Azure_AI Extension with the `azure_cognitive` Schema

The Azure_AI extension integrates Azure Cognitive Services' Summarization capabilities directly into SQL workflowsallowing the generation of abstractive summaries of SoWs or other financial documents using simple SQL commands.

## Abstractive Summarization

The extension's abstractive summarization capabilities provide a unique, natural-language summary that encapsulates the overall intent of the original text. This is performed by calling the `azure_cognitive.summarize_abstractive` function within the database. This will generate a 2-3 sentence summary of the text passed in.

```sql
azure_cognitive.summarize_abstractive('This is a document text', 'en', 2)
```

Consider the following PostgreSQL table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sows (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    number text NOT NULL,
    vendor_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NOT NULL,
    budget DECIMAL(18,2) NOT NULL,
    document text NOT NULL,
    metadata jsonb,
    summary text,
    FOREIGN KEY (vendor_id) REFERENCES vendors (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

```sql
-- Update the summary column with abstractive summaries
UPDATE sows
SET summary = azure_cognitive.summarize_abstractive(
    metadata,
    '{"max_sentence_count": 2}'
);
```

If you receive an error similar to the following, you chose a region that does not support abstractive summarization when creating your Azure environment:

```bash
ERROR: azure_cognitive.summarize_abstractive: InvalidRequest: Invalid Request.
InvalidParameterValue: Job task: 'AbstractiveSummarization-task' failed with validation errors: ['Invalid Request.']
InvalidRequest: Job task: 'AbstractiveSummarization-task' failed with validation error: Document abstractive summarization is not supported in the region Central US. The supported regions are North Europe, East US, West US, UK South, Southeast Asia.
```

To be able to perform this step and complete the remaining tasks using abstractive summarization, you must create a new Azure AI Language service in one of the supported regions specified in the error message. This service can be provisioned in the same resource group you used for other lab resources.

Alternatively, you may substitute extractive summarization using the `azure_cognitive.summarize_extractive` function for the remaining tasks but will not get the benefit of being able to compare the output of the two different summarization techniques.

```sql
azure_cognitive.summarize_extractive('This is a document text', 'en', 2)
```

## Insert Document Summary on Database Insert

Leveraging the `azure_cognitive.summarize_abstrative` method of the `azure_ai` extension, the database scripts are able to make calls to generate a document summary on INSERT or UPDATE.

Here's an example INSERT script used by the application when creating SOW records that includes the summarization:

```sql
INSERT INTO sows (number, start_date, end_date, budget, document, metadata, embeddings, summary, vendor_id)
VALUES (
    $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, 
    azure_openai.create_embeddings('embeddings', $7, throw_on_error => FALSE, max_attempts => 1000, retry_delay_ms => 2000),
    azure_cognitive.summarize_abstractive($7, 'en', 2)
    $8)
RETURNING *;
```
