# 4.3 Summarize documents

TODO: Use the `azure_ai` extension's `azure_cognitive` schema to perform abstractive summarization on SOWs (and invoices?).

TODO: Summaries should be created using the extension as part of an update statement on the tables.
TODO: Perhaps have a button on the UI that kicks off the summarization process, or should it be part of the ingestion process? If so, the docs here will need to have them build the final insert queries over a few steps and then run it at the end, so minor restructuring, but probably the right way to go.
