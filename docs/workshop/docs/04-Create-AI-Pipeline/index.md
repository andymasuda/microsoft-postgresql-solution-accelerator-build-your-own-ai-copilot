# AI-driven Data Validation

## The Challenges of Manual Document Ingestion

Wihtout AI-powered automation, processing invoices and Statements of Work (SOWs) was a time-consuming, manual task prone to errors and inconsistencies. Finance and operations teams had to:  

- **Manually collect and review documents**, often in different formats (PDFs, scanned images, emails).  
- **Extract key details by hand**, such as payment milestones, vendor details, and billable amounts.  
- **Cross-check invoices against SOWs**, verifying that charges matched contract terms— a tedious, error-prone process.  
- **Ensure compliance manually**, requiring human oversight to confirm correct contractual language and regulatory adherence.  
- **Reconcile discrepancies via back-and-forth communication**, leading to delays and inefficiencies.  

This manual approach **increased processing times, introduced human errors, and risked financial discrepancies**—causing unnecessary costs, compliance risks, and operational bottlenecks.  

## Building an AI-Enhanced Data Ingestion and Processing Pipeline

An end-to-end data pipeline has been created to create an AI-powered solution for advanced data analysis. This pipeline starts with documents uploaded to Azure Blob Storage and employs Azure services for intelligent ingestion, automated validation, semantic analysis, and optimized storage.

AI-driven Data Validation offers a transformative solution by automating document processing, improving accuracy, and reducing the burden on human reviewers. Through a combination of intelligent document ingestion, machine learning, and natural language processing, AI will revolutionize how contract validation is performed.

In this section, you will enable a feature flag that will activate the AI components of the solution.
